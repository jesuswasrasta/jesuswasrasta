# Hello!
I'm Ferdinando Santacroce 😀

👨‍💻 I’m in the software field since 1999.  

👨‍🏫 I've been a high school teacher,  
👲 but I currently work with teams and organizations as an agile (technical) coach.  

👨‍💼 I’m on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferdinandosantacroce/  
🐘 and even on Mastodon, https://mastodon.social/@ferdinandosantacroce.  

👯 I’ve a blog (nearly empty) at https://jesuswasrasta.com  
👨‍🎨 but I wrote something about Git https://jesuswasrasta.com/works/.  

👨‍🎤 I like to organize, participate and speak at conferences: https://jesuswasrasta.com/talks/
